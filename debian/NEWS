surf (0.4.1-6) unstable; urgency=high

  This release of surf fixes ~/.surf directory permission vulnerability
  CVE-2012-0842 reported in #659296. If you are upgrading from a previous
  version of surf you should manually change the permission of ~/.surf
  directory from 0755 to 0700 and permission for files inside ~/.surf
  directory from 0644 to 0600 using chmod. If you fail to do so other
  local users can steal your cookies. If this is a fresh install of surf
  you can ignore this message.
