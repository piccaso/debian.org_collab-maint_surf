surf (0.4.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  This release of surf fixes ~/.surf directory permission vulnerability.
  If you are upgrading from a previous version of surf you should consider
  manually changing permission of ~/.surf directory from 0755 to 0700 using
  chmod. If this is a fresh install of surf you can ignore this message.
